## 🐄 Livestock System
This is a Java-based simulation of a smart cattle farm that tracks animal locations, manages their feeding routines, and supports seasonal veterinary inspections and regulatory checks — all implemented by using object-oriented design patterns.

## 👨‍🌾 Project Overview
This software models a cattle farm where each animal is equipped with a device (Zigbee or Bluetooth) that tracks their location. 
The farm system:
  - Monitors cattle positions in real time,
  - Feeds animals according to their type (dairy or beef),
  - Notifies the farmer when animals leave the farm boundaries,
  - Supports periodic inspections and vaccinations.

## 🧠 Design Patterns Used

The system applies five key design patterns to structure the logic:
  - Abstract Factory Pattern
  - Adapter Pattern
  - Observer Pattern
  - Visitor Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern
